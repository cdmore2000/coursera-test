                    The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.

                <p>
                    Quality corned beef is a staple food in Jewish, Irish, and Caribbean cuisines. The meat is cured with “corn,” or large grains of salt, then slow-cooked for several hours. Since corned beef comes from a tough cut of brisket, it needs to be sliced up with care in order to make it tender. After letting the meat rest, cut it into thin slices across the grain to maximize its flavor.

                    Over the years we have tried to make this the most comprehensive list of terminology for foods one might find at a sushi restaurant. While we have worked hard, this list is by no means complete and we would love to hear any suggestion for additions from find in a Japanese restaurant. We thought to include items found in sushi, sashimi, courses, beverages, and accompaniments.You may notice that some of these items are links. Click on these links to go to a page devoted to that particular item to learn more about it and view images.
